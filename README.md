# Hotel Booking Analytics Project (Python | EDA + KPIs + Visualization)

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of hotel booking trends, performance metrics, and customer behavior using Python. The goal is to derive business insights that can help optimize hotel operations and improve revenue performance.

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze booking data to identify occupancy trends and revenue patterns
- Compute key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - **Occupancy Percentage (occ_pct)**
  - **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**
- Visualize important metrics using bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps
- Generate data-driven insights to inform operational decisions


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

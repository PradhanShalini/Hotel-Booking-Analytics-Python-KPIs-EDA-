# Hotel Booking Analytics Project (Python | EDA + KPIs + Visualization)

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of hotel booking trends, performance metrics, and customer behavior using Python. The goal is to derive business insights that can help optimize hotel operations and improve revenue performance.


  # 📊 Objectives

# - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on hotel booking datasets
# - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
# - Compute key hotel KPIs such as:
#     -> Occupancy Percentage (occ_pct)
#     -> Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)
#     -> Average Daily Rate (ADR)
#     -> Booking Lead Time
#     -> Cancellation Rate
#     -> No-Show Rate
# - Visualize trends across time, room categories, market segments, and booking sources
# - Identify peak and off-peak booking periods to assist with seasonal pricing strategies
# - Recommend data-driven strategies to improve hotel performance and operational efficiency
